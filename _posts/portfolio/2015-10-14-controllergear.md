description:       "When the marketing team of ControllerGear contacted me, their entire shipping system, using WooCommerce, was a mess. Shipping prices were high, taxes were wrong, and international shipping was not working.
<br /><br />
I implemented FedEx Shipping Options and USPS Shipping Options which lowered the shipping prices and gave users more options. I then hooked up their taxation system with TaxCloud.net’s service, which automated the Tax prices for all domestic states as well as international shipping. Finally, I implemented ShipStation’s service using their API to facilitate the shipping process.
<br /><br />
I also fixed some miscellaneous bugs with their site, and helped them with the design aspect of the site."
