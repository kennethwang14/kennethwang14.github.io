description:       "LUXWATCHES is a high-class wristwatch brand that seeks to produce the highest quality watches. Their old website was not responsive and they hired me to redesign a new one.

My design focuses on a professionalism and clean layout. It is easy to navigate, yet also has a luxurious and classy feel to it. I also redesigned their Blog with a similar style."
