description:       "I worked closely with the owner and marketing team of Mint & Basil to create their website during their launch week. I designed and developed a simple, yet elegant one-pager website that showcases their excellent food. The website is also integrated with Yelp using their API, allowing viewers to easily place a reservation online on the website.
<br /><br />
The owner was very satisfied with the end result, and Yelpâ€™s Analytic showed that the website did indeed help drive many new customers to their restaurant."
