description:       "I worked together with Satellite Country, one of the biggest DISH retailers in the United States, to redesign their previous website. The goal of the redesign was to give the website a fresh and modern look, while also generating more leads and customers. The client also wanted an easy to use content-management-system so employees with no development experience could easily modify the websiteâ€™s content, so the website was built on top of a heavily modified version of WordPress.
<br /><br />
In total, the website contains over 300 pages, and over 10 custom plugins, including a TV channel overview system. The client was very satisfied with the end result."
