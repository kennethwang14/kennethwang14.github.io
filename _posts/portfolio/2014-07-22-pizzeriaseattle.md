description:       "This is the website for Pizzeria Seattle, a new Italian restaurant. It features an online menu as well as an interactive booking system. The design layout was created with the goal of getting Pizzeria Seattle more customers. I also created the logo based on graphics found online (license purchased).
<br /><br />
The frontend was built entirely in WordPress using HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. The backend uses a modified version of WordPress and WooCommerce features custom plugins."
