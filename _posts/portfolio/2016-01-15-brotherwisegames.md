description:       "Brotherwise Games is an independent board games company founded by two brothers. After the huge success of their $200,000 Kickstarter, they reached out to me, saying that they wanted a complete and new branding.

Previously, their entire company was simply known as Boss Monster. However, they intended to publish more board games and wanted to differentiate their company from their flagship game. I helped them make various decisions on how to do that, and developed for them a completely new website. In the end, they were very satisfied with the results, and their fans loved it too."
