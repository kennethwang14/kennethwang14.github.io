In the next month, I developed a new website for her that is not only a huge visual upgrade, but also is much more powerful in the backend. The new site is fully integrated with various social media such as Facebook, SoundCloud, YouTube, and Instagram. There are also many new features including eCommerce. For the first time, her fans can now purchase her songs digitally on her website.
