description:       "My client required a mobile version of their site. I was provided with a Photoshop document of their draft and I implemented a responsive and pixel-perfect version using HTML5 and CSS3. In addition, I used JavaScript and jQuery to create a hamburger menu and a calendar widget to fit the design."
