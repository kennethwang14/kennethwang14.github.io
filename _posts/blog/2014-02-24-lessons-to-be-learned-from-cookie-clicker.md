<span style="visibility:hidden;">+++</span><span style="line-height:1.5;">In August 2013, a new internet sensation raided the online world: <a title="Cookie Clicker" href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" target="_blank">Cookie Clicker</a>. The game quickly went viral after its release and imprisoned the mind of all its users with its addictive nature. </span><span style="line-height:1.5;">Cookie Clicker is, in essence, a simple game where you gain cookies by clicking on a gigantic cookie. You can also invest in different options with your existing cookies to gain even more cookies. That’s all there is to it. There is no goal; no objective (except to bake more cookies!). Even the developer himself commented in a reddit Ask Me Anything that the game was developed as a joke.</span>

  <i>Developer Orteil admitting to Cookie Clicker being a joke game</i>
</p>

<span style="visibility:hidden;">+++</span><span style="line-height:1.5;">However, how did this seemingly pointless game become so popular and successful? Through game design theory, I will attempt to answer this question.</span>

<span style="visibility:hidden;">+++</span>**<span style="line-height:1.5;">Cookie Clicker, however simple of a game, actually follows many principles of good game design.</span>**

<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/tMHWkvI.png" width="624" height="296" />

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <i>What Cookie Clicker looks like when players first open it</i>
</p>

<span style="visibility:hidden;">+++</span><span style="line-height:1.5;">Let&#8217;s analyze the different parts of the game. First, the <strong>start</strong>. The game starts with most of the different panels empty, except the gigantic cookie on the left. It is surrounded by light, and a background of animated hearts. When hovered over, the cookie grows slightly bigger. When clicked on, a “+1” appears for a second as well as a small transparent cookie. The cookie counter display will then increase by 1.</span>

<span style="visibility:hidden;">+++</span><span style="line-height:1.5;">There are several observations to be made:</span>

  1. The gigantic cookie is the first thing players see when the game is first loaded, and the thing that captivates players the most. **The cookie is much more interesting visual-wise and curiosity-wise than anything else on the screen**.
  2. When the mouse is hovering over the cookie or when the cookie is clicked, there is visual feedback given back to the user. **This encourages users to interact with the cookie.**
  3. Once the gigantic cookie is clicked on, the cookie counter increases by 1. **The first time this happens, the player will be positively surprised and learn that clicking on the gigantic cookie will increase their overall cookie supply.**
  4. Players will notice that parts of the screen are empty. **This piques the curiosity of the players.**

<span style="visibility:hidden;">+++</span><span style="line-height:1.5;">In Jesse Schell’s <i>The Art of Game Design</i>, he defines <em>fun</em> as “<em>pleasure with surprises</em>” and <em>play</em> as “<em>manipulation that satisfies curiosity</em>”.  These are the most accepted definitions of the words, and those two concepts are the foundations of game design. To restate clearly, pleasurable surprises and curiosity are pretty damn important.</span>

<span style="visibility:hidden;">+++</span><span style="line-height:1.5;">The first minute of a game is the most crucial, especially in a free browser-based game, and will often decide whether the player thinks “this game is dumb” and permanently closes the game, or if he gives the game a try.<strong> As can be seen through our earlier analysis, f</strong><b>or the first minute of Cookie Clicker, players are guided to click on the cookie, which they will discover to be fun and playful. And as such, they will keep playing.</b></span>

<span style="visibility:hidden;">+++</span><span style="line-height:1.5;">As players gather more and more cookies, they will discover that items will fill the shop.</span>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <i>The &#8220;item visualization&#8221; panel (left) and the shop panel (right)</i>
</p>

<span style="visibility:hidden;">+++</span><span style="line-height:1.5;">Several observations are to be made, again:</span>

  1. The currency for the upgrades is cookies. **This gives endogenous value to the cookies, since they are now given a purpose (to buy upgrades) and further gives incentive for players to gain more cookies.**
  2. Upgrades increase the player’s rate of increase for cookies. **This, in-turn, gives endogenous value to having upgrades.**
  3. The silhouette for the next upgrade is shown once you reach a certain threshold. **This piques the players’ curiosity and further gives incentive for players to gain more cookies**.
  4. Each upgrade has a humorous description that is only available after purchasing the upgrade. It connects the upgrade to the unifying theme of cookies. **Having a unifying theme makes the game overall more interesting, and the humorous description acts as another curiosity piquing mechanic.**
  5. The threshold for the next upgrade to unlock is different from its price. For example, you must reach a threshold of 400 cookies to unlock the farm, but the farm costs 500 cookies. **This gives players a clear goal, a clear next-step. It gives the players direction.**
  6. Players don’t know what a new upgrade gives until after purchasing it. The new upgrades are also balanced in a way whereas the most recent upgrade is the most cost-effective. **This gives players a pleasurable surprise upon purchasing a new upgrade, as well as piques their curiosity.**
  7. When a new upgrade is purchased, a visualization of the upgrade will be displayed in the middle. **This again acts as a curiosity piquing mechanism.**

<span style="visibility:hidden;">+++</span><span style="line-height:1.5;">After the player has unlocked most of the upgrades and has cookies that add up to billions and trillions, <strong>the main driving force of the game is simply pride, and pride equates to pleasure.</strong></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <i>So many cookies!!!!</i>
</p>

<span style="visibility:hidden;">+++</span><span style="line-height:1.5;">So, to answer the question of how and why Cookie Clicker became so popular, it’s because Cookie Clicker is very <i>fun</i> to <i>play</i> with. The game is a genius at piquing player’s curiosity and awarding them with pleasurable surprises. Cookie Clicker is the subtle masterpiece of the gaming universe.</span>
